<p>
    When a colon is used in combination with an equality-like operator (such as <code>:=</code>), the colon may appear
    slightly vertically misaligned with the equality sign bars.
    The <code>mathtools</code> package provides replacement commands for a nicer visual result.

<p>
    <em>Note:</em>
    The <code>mathtools</code> package also provides a magical way to automatically use the right colon, by using <code>\mathtoolsset{centercolon}</code>.
    This removes the need of using the replacement commands.
    It is however not recommended, as this setting is not compatible with some <code>babel</code> languages (such as French).
    For more details, see section 3.7.2 of the <code>mathtools</code> documentation.

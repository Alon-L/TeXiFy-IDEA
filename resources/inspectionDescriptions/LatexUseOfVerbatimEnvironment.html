A verbatim environment might break TeXiFy's formatter and/or parser.
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
    There are two quick fixes available:
    <li>Move the verbatim environment to a new file.
    This new file will contain just the verbatim environment, and the formatter will be disabled on this file.
    Choose this fix if the verbatim environment caused parse errors.</li>
    <li>Surround the verbatim environment with comments that disable the formatter.</li>
</p>
<p>
    Bottom line: be careful with these statements and use a different command name where possible, unless you are very certain of what you are doing.
